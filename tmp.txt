Input your state in the format V|IF. (notation: M = Max, 0 = Zero, + = Pos, - Neg)
 For example +|0
+|+
Input the exogenous quantity behaviour as one of the following (must be consistent with your state)
Steady, Increasing, Decreasing, ParabolaPos, ParabolaNeg, Sinusoidal :
For Example: ParabolaPos
ParabolaNeg
Input complete. Start the reasoning!


------------------------ Step 1 --------------------------------
start to generate the shortest path of every state from  2021
-------------------------------------step 2---------------------------------------
Now that we have computed the shortest distance of all the states, we need to obtain the path
First, we compute the best terminating state:
we found a stable terminating state (DIF = 0, DV = 0) with the shortest distance:  2131
At step  1
Due to the negative effect of OF on V, which reduced the volumn
	The previous state IF( POS ,  NEG )
			 V( POS ,  ZERO ) H( POS ,  ZERO ) 
			Pr( POS ,  ZERO ) OF( POS ,  ZERO )
	The consequent state IF( POS ,  NEG )
			 V( POS ,  ZERO ) H( POS ,  ZERO ) 
			Pr( POS ,  ZERO ) OF( POS ,  ZERO )
At step  2
Due to the negative effect of OF on V, which reduced the volumn
	The previous state IF( POS ,  NEG )
			 V( POS ,  ZERO ) H( POS ,  ZERO ) 
			Pr( POS ,  ZERO ) OF( POS ,  ZERO )
	The consequent state IF( POS ,  NEG )
			 V( POS ,  NEG ) H( POS ,  NEG ) 
			Pr( POS ,  NEG ) OF( POS ,  NEG )
At step  3
Due to the effect of the change of DIF from NEG  to  ZERO
	The previous state IF( POS ,  NEG )
			 V( POS ,  NEG ) H( POS ,  NEG ) 
			Pr( POS ,  NEG ) OF( POS ,  NEG )
	The consequent state IF( POS ,  ZERO )
			 V( POS ,  NEG ) H( POS ,  NEG ) 
			Pr( POS ,  NEG ) OF( POS ,  NEG )
At step  4
Due to the effect of the change of DIF from ZERO  to  POS
	The previous state IF( POS ,  ZERO )
			 V( POS ,  NEG ) H( POS ,  NEG ) 
			Pr( POS ,  NEG ) OF( POS ,  NEG )
	The consequent state IF( POS ,  POS )
			 V( POS ,  ZERO ) H( POS ,  ZERO ) 
			Pr( POS ,  ZERO ) OF( POS ,  ZERO )
At step  5
Due to the negative effect of OF on V, which reduced the volumn
	The previous state IF( POS ,  POS )
			 V( POS ,  ZERO ) H( POS ,  ZERO ) 
			Pr( POS ,  ZERO ) OF( POS ,  ZERO )
	The consequent state IF( POS ,  POS )
			 V( POS ,  POS ) H( POS ,  POS ) 
			Pr( POS ,  POS ) OF( POS ,  POS )
At step  6
Due to the effect of the change of DIF from POS  to  ZERO
	The previous state IF( POS ,  POS )
			 V( POS ,  POS ) H( POS ,  POS ) 
			Pr( POS ,  POS ) OF( POS ,  POS )
	The consequent state IF( POS ,  ZERO )
			 V( MAX ,  ZERO ) H( MAX ,  ZERO ) 
			Pr( MAX ,  ZERO ) OF( MAX ,  ZERO )
